** Overview **

Poker is a commonly-played card game in which players try to assemble the "best" possible hand with the cards that they are given. Poker is most frequently played with a 52-card deck and up to 10 players. There are also multiple branches of Poker, and of these branches the focus of our project is on Five Card Draw.

Our goal in this project is to develop our own implementation of Five Card Draw (with a working multiplayer), which is a branch of Poker where at the start of a match, players are initially dealt five cards. From here, five completed "rounds" (a round referring to a full rotation of actions) need to take place before the match is finished. There are two types of rounds: discard rounds and wager rounds. After being dealt the first five cards, players take turns wagering, then discarding, then wagering again, then discarding again, and then wagering for the last time.

In the discard round, players are permitted to select up to 5 cards and replace them for a new set of cards from the deck. The victory condition of the game is to obtain a hand that is considered stronger than the hands of the other players by the end of the match. Hands are ranked in order of strength from least to greatest by the following measure: high card, one pair of the same number, two pairs of two different numbers, three-of-a-kind, straight (five cards in ascending order), flush (five cards of the same suit), a full house (a three-of-a-kind with a pair), four-of-a-kind, straight flush (a straight combined with a flush), and royal flush (a flush where the cards are numbered 10 to Ace).

In wager rounds, each player takes turns deciding whether they want to wager as much as is already on the board (Call), wager more than what is currently on the board (Raise), or forfeit their hand and any chance of winning the match (Fold). A Call is done to match an existing bet so that the player can stay in for another set of turns, while a Raise is done to try and increase the amount of money at stake on the board. Folding is done if a player does not want to  put any more money into the round.

When all of the rounds have finished, players reveal their hands, and the player with the best hand takes all of the money that has been wagered.

** Technologies / Implementation **

** Features **

In our application, we intend to include a number of features which simulate what an implementation of Five Card Draw might look like.

*User Profiles*: An authentication system will be in place so that users can properly log in to play Five Card Draw and log out when they are done with their session. Users should be able to register an account, and those who create an account will have their own user profile in which they can display and edit basic information such as their name and profile picture. Each user account will also start off by default with a set amount of money which they can use to participate in matches. In addition, each player is associated with lifetime statistics such as wins and losses which will be displayed in the leaderboard as described below.

*Lobby System*: Our application displays a list of existing lobbies and permits the user to create a lobby of their own, as shown in Figure 1. The list of lobbies is not a static page and constantly updates itself to show users what rooms are available.

*Gameplay*: The gameplay itself can be split up into several aspects, including the game logic, the timer, and the AI. In the Overview, we discussed the manner in which Five Card Draw is played, and in our application we have written code in Go that directly handles the sequence of turns, actions that can be taken (i.e. discard rounds and wager rounds), and determining who the victor of a match is. A timer will also prevent players from taking an indefinite period of time to make a move, and the AI will be able to follow the rules of Five Card Draw at a bare minimum. Figure 2 shows what a match of Five Card Draw would look like in our application.

*Multiplayer*: Five Card Draw is a game meant to be played with multiple other people, so being able to connect with others would be an expected part of our application. At the moment, we are trying to implement a version of Five Card Draw that supports up to 6 simultaneous players at once per lobby.

*Leaderboard*: A leaderboard exists that keeps track of user statistics. In this case, user statistics refer to information collected about a player's performance during their account's lifetime, such as the number of wins, losses, draws, folds, and amount of money held by that user. These statistics are obtained after the conclusion of each Poker match, and then the leaderboard is updated to reflect the changes in the player's performance.
